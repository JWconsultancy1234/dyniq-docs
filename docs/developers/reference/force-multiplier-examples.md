# Force Multiplier Examples

Quick reference for assessing strategic work value.

## Score 10: Exponential Value (Build First, Use Forever)

| System | 1x Build Cost | ∞x Use Value | ROI Timeline |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| walker-os itself | 40h initial | Every day saved | Immediate |
| Board meeting command | 4h design + 2h build | Every strategic decision | Week 1 |
| SPCL framework | 2h design + 8h build | Every content piece | Week 1 |
| Decision filter | 1h design | Every task evaluated | Immediate |
| Timeblock system | 8h design + 4h build | Every work session | Immediate |

**Characteristics:**
- Used multiple times per week (10+)
- Changes HOW work happens (not just WHAT work)
- Creates institutional memory
- Enables automation/delegation later

**When to Prioritize:** ALWAYS. Even if implementation cost is 10x higher than Score 1 work.

---

## Score 5: Recurring Value (Weekly/Monthly Use)

| System | Build Cost | Use Frequency | Value Per Use |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| /daily-plan command | 3h | 7x/week | 30 min saved |
| /weekly-plan command | 4h | 1x/week | 60 min saved |
| /validate command | 2h | 5x/week | 10 min saved |
| /commit command | 2h | 10x/week | 5 min saved |

**Characteristics:**
- Used weekly or monthly
- Saves time each use
- Reduces manual process errors
- Improves consistency

**When to Prioritize:** After Score 10 work, before Score 1 work.

---

## Score 1: One-Time Value (Feature/Fix)

| Work | Build Cost | Use Frequency | Value |
|------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Single feature | 2-8h | Once | Feature value |
| Bug fix | 1-4h | Once | Prevents issue |
| UI improvement | 2-6h | Once | Better UX |
| Content piece | 1-2h | Once | Engagement |

**Characteristics:**
- Solves specific problem once
- Doesn't change workflow
- Limited reuse potential

**When to Prioritize:** After Score 10 and Score 5 work completed.

---

## Decision Tree

```
Is this work reusable?
├─ No → Score 1 (one-time)
└─ Yes → How often will it be used?
    ├─ Weekly+ → Does it change HOW work happens?
    │   ├─ Yes → Score 10 (exponential)
    │   └─ No → Score 5 (recurring)
    └─ Monthly or less → Score 1-5 (case by case)
```

## Tonight's Examples (2026-01-25)

**Board Meeting Command: Score 10**
- Build: 6h total (4h design tonight + 2h implementation tomorrow)
- Use: Every strategic decision (4+ times per week estimated)
- Value: Systematic decisions + institutional memory + 30-day reviews
- ROI: Week 1 (used immediately for MoltBot/Tambo/Pencil)

**SPCL Framework: Score 10**
- Build: 10h total (2h design tonight + 8h implementation Week W05)
- Use: Every content piece (4-5 posts/week target)
- Value: ICP-aligned content from journey data
- ROI: Week 1 (first content batch published)

**MoltBot Research (Manual): Score 1**
- Build: 1h research
- Use: One decision (adopt or pass)
- Value: Tool evaluation
- ROI: Single decision

**Decision Made:** Build Score 10 infrastructure (board meeting) FIRST, then use it for Score 1 work (research). Correct prioritization.
