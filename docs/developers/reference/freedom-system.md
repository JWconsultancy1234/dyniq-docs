# Walker-OS Freedom System

The personal operating system for financial freedom by July 2026.

## The Two Paths

### Path A: BolScout (Long Game)
- **Ownership**: 45% (Mohammed 10% economic only, no voting)
- **Target**: €470M exit by 2030
- **Your Take**: €117M after tax
- **Time Horizon**: 5 years

### Path B: Quick AI Product (Freedom Game)
- **Ownership**: 100%
- **Target**: €10k/month recurring
- **Purpose**: Replace Argenx by July 2026
- **Time Horizon**: 6-12 months

## Decision Filter (4-Step Process)

See @.claude/agents/freedom-filter.md for the complete decision framework.

**Quick Reference:**
1. **BUY BACK TIME** - Worth €72/hr?
2. **WHO NOT HOW** - Can someone else own this?
3. **PATH ALIGNMENT** - Serves Path A/B?
4. **FREEDOM IMPACT** - Moves the needle?

**Outcomes**: `DO_NOW`, `DELEGATE`, `SCHEDULE`, `DEPRIORITIZE`, `CUT`

## Profit First (6-Bucket Model)

| Bucket | % | Purpose |
|--------|---|---------|
| Fixed Costs | 50% | Rent, bills, essentials |
| Financial Freedom | 15% | Investment fund |
| Play Money | 12.5% | Guilt-free spending |
| Long-term Savings | 10% | Emergency fund |
| Education | 10% | Books, courses, mentors |
| Charity/Zakat | 2.5% | Islamic obligation |

## Quadrant Shift Tracker

| Quadrant | Current | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| E (Employee) | 40 hrs @ Argenx | 0 by July 2026 |
| S (Self-employed) | 0 | 0 |
| B (Business owner) | 5-10 hrs BolScout | 20+ hrs |
| I (Investor) | 0 | 5 hrs/week |

**Direction**: E → B → I (never S)

## Timeblock System

| Block | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| First 90 | 4:15-5:45 AM | Highest priority |
| Deep Work 2 | 5:55-6:45 AM | Continue/debug |
| Midday B | 12:00-14:00 | B-Quadrant work |
| Afternoon B | 16:00-17:30 | B-Quadrant work |

**Commands:**
- `/begin-timeblock` - Load context, start block
- `/end-timeblock` - A-Z summary, update daily plan

## Weekly Review (1-2 hours)

1. **Freedom Dashboard** - Are we closer to €10k/mo?
2. **Path A check** - What moved BolScout forward?
3. **Path B check** - What revenue was generated?
4. **Time audit** - Hours on €72+ activities?
5. **Quadrant check** - Time in E/S vs B/I?
6. **Money blueprint** - Following allocations?
7. **Next week** - Top 3 needle-movers only

## Current Baseline (Jan 2026)

- **Argenx Income**: €10-15k/month (EXIT: July 2026)
- **Freedom Target**: €10k/month from Path B
- **BolScout Equity**: 45% (Adam 45%, Mohammed 10% economic only)
- **Days to Freedom**: 145

## Book Frameworks Integrated

| Book | Key Principle | Where Applied |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Buy Back Your Time | €72/hr filter, DRIP matrix | Decision Filter |
| Who Not How | Find WHO, not HOW | Decision Filter |
| Rich Dad Poor Dad | E/S → B/I shift | Quadrant Tracker |
| Cashflow Quadrant | Track allocation | Weekly Review |
| 100M Money Models | Offer creation | Path B Design |

## The Only Question

> "Does this action buy back my time or build my freedom?"

If no, don't do it.
