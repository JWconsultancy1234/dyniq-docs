# Sales Frameworks Reference

Detailed frameworks from Dan Martell and Alex Hormozi for chat-based selling.

---

## Content That Commands Attention (Martell)

### The 4 Content Pillars

**1. Speak to Their Pain (Not About You)**

```
WRONG: "Here's what I did..."
RIGHT: "Here's how this can help you..."
```

**Rule:** Explain their pain BETTER than they can = you become the expert.

**Pain Examples by Industry:**
- Dentist: "You laugh with lips pressed tight... one photo tag and your confidence vanishes"
- Fitness: "Your jeans button leaves a red mark so deep it follows you into the shower"
- Marketing: "You spend hours on a post your mom 'likes'... and no one else sees"
- Sales: "Your DMs look full... but it's just ghosts who stopped replying after 'what's the price?'"

**2. Find Your Format**

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Before & After Reveal | Services, transformations |
| Listicle / Quick Tips | Education, saves |
| Day-in-the-Life | Connection, authenticity |
| Story-Time | Lessons, turning points |
| How-To / Mini Tutorial | Expertise, save-worthy |
| Walk & Talks | Approachable, friendly |

**3. Pre-Validation (Listen to Algorithm)**

```
1. List 10 creators in your topic
2. Sort their content by Popular (TikTok/IG)
3. Find viral posts from past 4 months
4. Make list of 50 ideas
5. Write YOUR answers to those concepts
```

**Key:** Be inspired, don't copy. Follow hook structure.

**4. Consistency Beats Perfection**

```
Every post = lottery ticket
Pre-validation = multiplied chances
90-day commitment minimum
```

**The Flywheel:**
1. Post reels
2. Check data (follow-to-view ratio)
3. Identify winning format
4. Double down on that format
5. Repeat with different topics

**Remember:** "You'll get bored with your marketing before your market ever does."

## The $100M Money Model (Hormozi)

### Three Stages of Revenue

```
Stage I:  GET CASH         → Attraction Offers (get customers for less)
Stage II: GET MORE CASH    → Upsell & Downsell Offers (make more faster)
Stage III: GET THE MOST CASH → Continuity Offers (maximize lifetime value)
```

### Attraction Offers

| Offer Type | How It Works | Best For |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Win Your Money Back** | Set goal, refund if achieved | High-commitment customers |
| **Buy X Get Y Free** | Free stuff with purchase | Increasing order value |
| **Decoy Offer** | Free/cheap option vs premium | Steering to premium |
| **Pay Less Now/More Later** | Discount for immediate action | Creating urgency |

### Upsell Offers

| Type | Script Pattern |
|------|---------------|
| **Classic Upsell** | "You can't have X without Y!" |
| **Menu Upsell** | "Which package fits your needs?" |
| **Anchor Upsell** | Show expensive first, then "better fit" |
| **Rollover Upsell** | "Since you spent €X, credit it toward Y" |

### Downsell Offers

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Payment Plan** | "Half now, rest over time" |
| **Trial** | "Start free if you do X, Y, Z" |
| **Feature Downsell** | "Without guarantee, I can knock off €400" |

### Continuity Offers

| Type | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Continuity Bonus** | Awesome thing if they sign up today |
| **Continuity Discount** | Free time now or later |
| **Waived Fee** | Big setup fee waived for commitment |

## Sell By Chat Framework (Martell)

### The 5-Step Chat Sale

```
1. OPENING      → Personalized, pattern-interrupt
2. QUALIFYING   → A-B Method (Current → Desired → Gap)
3. PAIN PROBE   → Stretch the gap, find emotional trigger
4. SOLUTION     → Position as the bridge
5. OFFER        → Clear options with risk reversal
```

### Step 1: Opening

**Pattern Interrupt Examples:**
- "Saw you just [specific thing]. How's that going?"
- "Quick question—are you still working on [X]?"
- "Just noticed [observation]. Curious..."

**Either-Or Questions:**
- "Are you more focused on [A] or [B] right now?"
- "Is this a now thing or a later thing?"

### Step 2: A-B Method (Qualifying)

```
Version 1 (Current State)
    ↓ Questions to understand where they are
    ↓
Version 2 (Desired State)
    ↓ Questions to understand where they want to be
    ↓
THE GAP
    ↓ The bigger the gap, the more they'll pay
    ↓
Challenges/Roadblocks
    ↓ What's stopping them?
```

**Current State Questions:**
- "How satisfied are you with [current situation]?"
- "What are you currently trying for growth?"
- "How long has that been going on?"

**Desired State Questions:**
- "In 12 months, what kind of life would you like to create?"
- "What's the big goal with it?"
- "If we were to work together, what are ideal outcomes?"

**Challenge Questions:**
- "What do you feel is holding you back?"
- "What's missing to reach [goal]?"
- "Top 3 things slowing you down?"

### Step 3: Pain Probe

**Stretch the Gap:**
- "How long have you been trying to [X] for?"
- "How has this been impacting you personally?"
- "How much money have you missed out on because of that?"
- "How will you feel if you're in the same place a year from now?"

**No Pain = No Next Step**

If no pain surfaces, label it:
- "I see a lot of [AVATAR] experiencing [X, Y, Z] problems lately... Have you been experiencing something similar?"

### Step 4: Solution

**Position as Expert:**
- "These are areas I explicitly work on when coaching clients"
- "[Need] to ramp up to [goal] is right up my alley"
- "Last year on average, I helped clients reduce churn by 32%"

**Test Commitment:**
- "How important is this to you on a scale of 1-10?"
- "Is this a NICE to have or a MUST-have?"
- "I only work with action-takers. Are you ready to commit?"

**Rule:** At least 9 messages before moving to offer.

### Step 5: The Offer

**Rapid-Fire Setup:**
```
Just launched a new (offer)...
Help accelerate + accountability

## Objection Handling

### The 5 Secrets

1. **Abundance Mindset** - Act like there's a line waiting
2. **Compete with Inaction** - Not other offers, but doing nothing
3. **Never Make Them Feel Wrong** - Empathy keeps them open
4. **Objections = Interest** - They're still thinking about buying
5. **Reframe, Don't Answer** - Redefine the concern

### Common Objections

| Objection | Reframe |
|-----------|---------|
| "It's expensive" | "Most people who said that at first later realized it's more expensive not to fix this." |
| "I need to think" | "Of course. Usually that means you're thinking if this is the right move... what part feels unclear?" |
| "Talk to spouse" | "What do you think their main concern will be?" → Then handle THAT |
| "I'm too busy" | "That's exactly why people do this—to buy back their time." |

## Follow-Up System

### Active Pipeline (They're Engaged)

```
Frequency: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 days

After 30 min: Like their message or engage with profile
After 60 min: Ping—"Get my note?" / "[Name]?" / "Sorry, I got busy"
Day 2: "[Name]?"
Day 4: "[Name] I'm worried about you :-o"
Day 6: Meme/GIF/Funny photo
Day 10: "Would you like to continue or should I close your file?"
```

### Reactivate Pipeline (Gone Cold)

```
Frequency: Once or twice a month

Value-Based: "Just created a new training on X, thought of you"
Event-Based: "Getting unreal results for clients, made me think of you"
The Reactivator: "Are you still trying to figure out [their specific problem]?"
```
