# Sprint 1: Documentation Foundation

The first sprint of the Documentation Hub initiative established the core infrastructure and migrated foundational content from internal references to a structured documentation site.

## What Was Delivered

### Site Infrastructure
- Docusaurus 3.9 site with custom theme (dark mode default)
- GxP-compliant frontmatter on all pages (`doc_owner`, `review_cycle`, `doc_status`)
- Custom `DocMetadata` component showing document governance info
- CI/CD pipeline: spell check, link check, build, deploy to Contabo

### Content Migrated (18 pages)
- **Architecture docs** - System overview, board meeting pipeline, model routing
- **API reference** - Authentication, board meeting, content, style transfer, vision endpoints
- **Infrastructure** - Deployment guide, troubleshooting reference
- **SOPs** - Client onboarding, brand voice, deployment, agent creation, n8n debugging
- **Guides** - Getting started, board meeting usage, webhook integration

### Navigation
- 5 sidebar sections: Developers, Guides, Workflows, Internal, API Explorer
- Footer with documentation links, platform links, and changelog

## Sprint Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Issues completed | 11/11 |
| Story points | 18 SP |
| Pages created | 18 |
| Time to complete | ~4 hours |

## Technical Decisions

- **Docusaurus over Nextra/GitBook** - Better plugin ecosystem, Mermaid support, versioning
- **GxP frontmatter** - Enables future compliance tracking without additional tooling
- **Autogenerated sidebars** - Reduces maintenance as new pages are added
